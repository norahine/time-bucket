# Time Bucket

Time Bucket is a hobby project that I created using Ruby on Rails. It is a tool to help you keep track of your time.

### How can I use it?
It is simple. Create an account. Enter a name of an activity you wish to track, and add it to your list. Once you have done so, simply choose the activity to track from you list, and start the timer. If you wish, you may enter the time manually instead.

All you activities will be added to a calendar and you can see them in the "Reports" section of the app.

Bear in mind that Time Bucket is still a work in progress. I am planning to add more features soon (ex: ability to set goals, graphical reports, ability to re-order and group the list of activities). If you have any enhancement ideas on your mind, or found a bug, please create an issue.

You can see a [live demo of the app here](http://time-bucket.herokuapp.com).
